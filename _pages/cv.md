Research Experience
======
* 2023–Present: Graduate Student, The Ohio State University
  * *Studying galactic chemical evolution through Mangenese abundances* 
    * Modeling galactic chemical evolution with a 2-process model based on TypeIa and Core Collapse Supernovae enrichments
    * Using metallicity dependant yields for Mangenese to model its abundances
    * Investigating a model for two distinct populations of white dwarf progenitors for Mn production

  * *Studying Formation of Iron-rich, Mercury-like planets via N-body Simulations*
    * Mercury has a core mass fraction (CMF) of nearly 0.7, more than double that of the Earth (~0.3). 
    * Exoplanetary counterparts to Mercury exibit extremely high densities, and their origins are unknown.
    * This project aimed at studying different formation pathways of Mercury-like planets, focusing on late stage planet formation and collisional fragmentation.

  * *REBOUNDX Collisional Fragmentation Module*
    * Studying collisions between bodies in the protoplanetary disk, leading to the formation of rocky planets
    * Simulating different collision outcomes including fragmentation, partial erosion, and partial accretion
    * Investigating possible planet composition and structure as a result of giant impacts in the disk, especially in the context of high-density planets (Exo-Mercuries)

  * *Small Planets Demographics*
    * Making a comprehensive list of highly dense and Iron-rich planets by comparing them to models of rocky Earth-like planets (e.g. ExoPlex) with various core-mass fractions and compositions
    * Using archival data and exoplanet fitting tools such as EXOFASTv2 to obtain best mass and radius measurements
* 2021–2023: Undergraduate Researcher, Sharif University of Technology
  * *Simulation of two-phase fluid flow in Oscillating Water Columns with ANSYS FLUENT*
    * Numerical Simulation of air and water flow in Oscillating Water Columns, which are a type of wave energy converter. Investigated the different column geometry affecting the efficiency of OWCs.
