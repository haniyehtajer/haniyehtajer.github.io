Education
======
* Ph.D in Astronomy, The Ohio State University, Expected Graduation: 2029
* B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Philosophy, Sharif University of Technology, 2023

Awards & Honors
======
* LSST Discovery Alliance Data Science Fellowship, *2025-present*
* Graduate Student Fellowship, The Ohio State University, *2023*

Research Experience
======
* 2023–Present: Graduate Student, The Ohio State University
  * *Studying galactic chemical evolution through manganese abundances* 
    * Modeling galactic chemical evolution with a two-process model based on Type Ia and core-collapse supernova enrichments
    * Using metallicity-dependent yields for manganese to model its abundances
    * Investigating a model involving two distinct populations of white dwarf progenitors for Mn production

  * *Studying the formation of iron-rich, Mercury-like planets via N-body simulations*
    * Mercury has a core mass fraction (CMF) of nearly 0.7, more than double that of the Earth (~0.3). 
    * Exoplanetary counterparts to Mercury exhibit extremely high densities, and their origins remain unknown
    * This project aims to study different formation pathways for Mercury-like planets, focusing on late-stage planet formation and collisional fragmentation

  * *REBOUNDX Collisional Fragmentation Module*
    * Developing a collision prescription in the open-source package [REBOUNDx](https://github.com/dtamayo/reboundx), an extension to the N-body code [REBOUND](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound)
    * This module accounts for various collision outcomes, such as fragmentation and hit-and-run events
