Research Experience
======
* 2023–Present: Graduate Student, The Ohio State University
  * *N-body Simulation of Late Stages of Planet Formation*
    * Studying collisions between bodies in the protoplanetary disk, leading to the formation of rocky planets
    * Simulating different collision outcomes including fragmentation, partial erosion, and partial accretion
    * Investigating possible planet composition and structure as a result of giant impacts in the disk, especially in the context of high-density planets (Exo-Mercuries)
  * *Small Planets Demographics*
    * Making a comprehensive list of highly dense and Iron-rich planets by comparing them to models of rocky Earth-like planets (e.g. ExoPlex) with various core-mass fractions and compositions
    * Using archival data and exoplanet fitting tools such as EXOFASTv2 to obtain best mass and radius measurements
