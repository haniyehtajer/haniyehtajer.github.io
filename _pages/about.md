I'm a graduate student at the Ohio State University, a member of the exoplanets research group, and a LSST Discovery Alliance Data Science Fellow. I work with Dr. Ji Wang, mainly on late-stage planet formation, rocky planet composition, and exo-Mercuries.

Research
======
I conduct N-body simulations of late-stage planet formation, where erosive collisions between rocky bodies occur, leading to fragmentation and changes in their composition. I am particularly interested in understanding the formation of Mercury and exo-Mercuries. To read more about this research checkout [this webpage!](https://haniyehtajer.github.io/research/) 

My other interests include planetary models, exoplanet compositions, the radius gap, and exo-Mercury detections. 

Biography
====
I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2023, with a minor in Philosophy, from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. I made a huge leap into planetary science by joining the Earth Science PhD program in the Fall of 2023. I began working with the exoplanet research group at The Ohio State University, advised by Dr. Ji Wang. I am continuing my graduate studies at the Astronomy department at the Ohio State University starting in the Fall of 2025.

In my free time, I mostly climb rocks (and plastic holds), but I also enjoy backpacking, hiking, reading, watching movies, and spending time with my friends.
