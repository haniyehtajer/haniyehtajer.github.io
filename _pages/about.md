I'm a PhD student in Astronomy at the Ohio State University, and a LSST Discovery Alliance Data Science Fellow. I work on multiple different things, from exoplanets to galaxies!

Research
====
My exoplanet research is focused on formation pathways of Iron-rich, Mercury-like planets through N-body Simulations (advised by Dr. Ji Wang). I'm also working on developing comprehensive fragmentation and mantle-stripping modules in [REBOUNDx](https://github.com/dtamayo/reboundx). 

On the galactic side, I am interested in Galactic Chemical Evolution and am currently working on modeling metallicity-dependent yields for manganese (advised by Dr. David Weinberg).

Biography
====
I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2023, with a minor in Philosophy, from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. I made a giant leap into Astronomy in graduate school, and am enjoying it to the fullest by working on multiple projects. 

In my free time, I mostly climb rocks (and plastic holds), but I also enjoy backpacking and hiking, biking, running, reading, watching movies, and spending time with my friends.
