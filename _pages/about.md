I'm a graduate student at the Ohio State University, a member of the exoplanets research group, and a LSST Discovery Alliance Data Science Fellow. I work with Dr. Ji Wang, mainly on late-stage planet formation, rocky planet composition, and exo-Mercuries.

Research
======
I do N-body simulations of late-stage planet formation, where erosive collisions between rocky bodies happen, leading to fragmentation and change in their composition. I am specially interested in understanding Mercury and Exo-Mercuries formation. To read more about this research checkout [this webpage!](haniyehtajer.github.io/research/) 

My other interests include planetary models and exoplanet compositions, radius gap, exo-Mercury detections, etc. 

Biography
====
I graduated in Mechanical Engineering at 2023 with a minor in Philosophy from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. I took a huge leap into planetary science, as I joined the Earth Science PhD program in the Fall of 2023. I began working with the exoplanet research group at the Ohio State University, advised by Dr. Ji Wang. In my free time, I mostly climb rocks (and plastic holds), but I also enjoy running, backpacking, hiking, reading, watching movies and spending time with my friends.
